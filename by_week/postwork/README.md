# Postwork

Thought you were done with me, eh?

Not so fast.

As you continue your job search, it's important to keep your coding
knife sharp and to _keep learning_.

Here's what I recommend:

## Keep coding

Make it a habit to keep coding _every day_, even if it's just a little.
Set aside 30 minutes (minimum) each day to code _something_.

Some suggestions:

* Add features to your final project.
* Add tests to your final project.
* Clean up the code of your final project.
* Revisit old homework.
* http://exercism.io/
* [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) (bonus: good testing practice as
  well)
* Build a better Twitter clone - and try to get as close to feature
  parity with actual Twitter as you can.

## Get plugged in

The Ruby community is vast. To get plugged into the community and keep
up with it as it changes, I recommend subscribing to or following along
with the following (in addition to ye olde [indy.rb](http://indyrb.org):

* [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/) - Email newsletter
* [Ruby Inside](http://www.rubyinside.com/) - Blog
* [The Bike Shed](http://bikeshed.fm/) - Podcast
* [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/) - Podcast
* [Ruby on Rails podcast](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails) - Podcast

More than the above, _stay curious_. Some of the above will point you to
other interesting corners of the internet ... go with it.

## Expand your skills

Remember when I may have mentioned that picking up one language makes it
easier to pick up another? Why not explore some of the below languages,
paradigms or platforms:

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Javascript framework
* [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) - Javascript framework
* [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) - Programming language
  (Apple)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming language
* [Lotus](http://lotusrb.org/) - Ruby web framework (like Rails)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Javascript on the server

## Expand your circle

Going to indy.rb is great, but there are a ton of other programming
gathering around town. Why not explore some of these:

* [IndyPy](http://www.meetup.com/indypy/) - Python meetup
* [IndyJS](http://www.meetup.com/indyjs/) - Javascript meetup
* [Dev Workshop](http://www.meetup.com/Dev-Workshop-Indy/) -
  Javascript/Laravel Meetup (bonus: our new Frontend Instructor runs the
Laravel side)

## Final thoughts ...

Most of the above boils down to one thing: Stay curious and keep
building. Your learning as a developer did not end at Demo Day or course
end - it's only begun.

Keep building, keep stretching ...

And good luck out there!
