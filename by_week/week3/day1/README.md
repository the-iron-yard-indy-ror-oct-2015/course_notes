# Blackjack and Git

Today, we walked through our Blackjack lab and also introduced git.

You can find my blackjack solution over in this repo: https://github.com/the-iron-yard-indy-ror-oct-2015/blackjack

For funsies, you can compare and contrast with how I solved it with the last cohort: https://github.com/tiy-indianapolis-ror-june2015/blackjack/blob/master/game.rb (Of note: That one includes a Nightmare mode solution, though I'd solve it differently these days).

I mentioned these in the assignment, but:

http://samkap.github.io/command-line-starter-kit/ - An Iron Yard Austin production walking through common command line and git commands.

https://guides.github.com/ - Loads of guides about different aspects of Git and GitHub.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEHhfG9vJzVCTiDYcbhAiEqL - GitHub training videos for Git basics.

Also: Tomorrow, we get into HTML. If you haven't done [the prework](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) related to HTML/CSS, I'd suggest you do so.
