* More is better than less
* A peer is better than a google search
* A google search is better than staring into the abyss
* Stargazing is better than giving up
* Asking for help is always encouraged
* "I don't understand" is a valid and encouraged thing to say
* Sharing is good, but always include a source. Do not spread misinformation
* Slack is your friend
* Be open when you are struggling, feeling behind, or overwhelmed. We're all in this together and we're all here to help.
