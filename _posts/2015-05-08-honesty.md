I cannot stress enough the importance of honesty and open communication.

For the sake of Clarity, we'll define Honesty as:

>Honesty - sincere, blameless, fairly earned, simple, unpretentious, and free of deceit.

Being dishonest - especially when it comes to misrepresenting the work you're doing for class (read: cheating) - can and will be dealt with _harshly_. To be specific: explusion is very much on the table. Don't do it. There's no reason to do it.
