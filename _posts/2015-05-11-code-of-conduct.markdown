<p>Like the technical community as a whole, classes at The Iron Yard are made up of a mixture of people from all different backgrounds.</p>

<p>Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
people to adhere to when they're taking a class at The Iron Yard. These rules
apply equally to teachers, students, other staff, and guest lecturers.</p>

<p>This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather,
take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier
to enrich all of us, the technical communities in which we
participate.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes in
class, Slack, email, and other forums such as Skype, Google+ Hangouts,
etc.</p>

<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that
you report it by talking to your teacher. If you do not feel comfortable
talking to your teacher, speak with any Iron Yard teacher or campus
director.</p>

<ul>   <li>     <p><strong>Be welcoming, friendly, and
patient.</strong></p>   </li>   <li>     <p><strong>Be
considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in
turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will
affect your colleagues, and you should take those consequences into
account when making decisions.</p>   </li>   <li>     <p><strong>Be
respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but
disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might
all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember
that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a
productive one. Members of the Iron Yard community should be respectful
when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Iron
Yard community.</p>   </li>   <li>     <p><strong>Be careful in the
words that you choose.</strong> Be kind to others. Do not insult or put
down other people. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and
sexist, racist, or exclusionary behavior are not appropriate for this
class. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

    <ul>   <li>Violent threats or language directed against another
    person.</li>   <li>Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes
    and language.</li>   <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent
    material.</li>   <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist
    or sexist terms.</li>   <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
    <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
    <li>     <p>Repeated harassment of others.         In general, if
    someone asks you to stop, then stop.</p>   </li> </ul>
    </li>           <li> <p><strong>When we disagree, we try to
    understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social         and
    technical, happen all the time and The Iron Yard is no exception. It
    is         important that we resolve disagreements and differing
    views constructively.         Remember that we're different. The
    strength of The Iron Yard comes from its         varied members,
    people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have
    different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why
    someone holds         a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong.
    Don't forget that it is human to         err and blaming each other
    doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help         resolving
    issues and to help learn from mistakes.</p>           </li>
    </ul>

Personal addendum: If you tell a joke or make a comment and then immediately look at another person in the group to see if they're OK with it, it's no good. Here's a good explanation of this phenomenon: <https://twitter.com/glebd/status/594916554015436800>
