# Welcome
I hope you all are as excited as I am about getting this class started. It is in the best interest of everyone to make sure you as prepared as possible for the coming twelve weeks. Through large amounts of hard work and determination, you will learn, grow, and achieve.

Hopefully, we'll also have a bit of fun along the way as well.

Remember, we are all in this together. We will have individual assignments and group assignments. Always be willing and ready to help your peers.

Thank you for your commitment and hard work. It will be rewarded.

There are quite a few tasks and topics that are necessary to take care of before we can actually start learning how to be Ruby and Rails developers. Rather than using class time to get through these, I expect that you can accomplish and learn these things without assistance so that we can spend class time only on those things that are difficult to learn on your own. If you have any questions or confusion about these tasks, please [email me](mailto:chris.vannoy@theironyard.com) so I can help you work through them.

## Objectives
The following are the learning objectives for this prework, all of which are important requirements expected of a professional developer. Though they are not technically “programming” skills, they are crucially important to success both during the class and on the job.

1. Be able to communicate technical accomplishments and struggles in writing.
2. Be able to learn in contexts that aren’t necessarily suited to your primary learning style.
3. Adapt to the workflows used by professional developers (using the command line in particular)
4. Describe the importance of mindset on learning and be able to analyze one’s own type of mindset.

## Mindset
1. Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)
2. Compose an [email to me (Chris)](mailto:chris.vannoy@theironyard.com) answering the following questions:
- What aspects of the Growth and Fixed mindset can you identify in your personal history? In what areas do you feel Fixed? Where do you see the most Growth?
- What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?

## Practical Advice

["How to Win The Iron Yard"](https://medium.com/@SchnettHappens/how-to-win-the-iron-yard-646cdc11f7a0) is a great compilation of advice for new Iron Yard students. Bonus: It's compiled by a _current_ Iron Yard student.

## Computer Setup

### Install OSX Yosemite, if you haven’t already
1.	You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).
2.	Download the Yosemite upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12).
3.	Double-click "Install OS X Yosemite” to begin installation.
WARNING: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.

### Additional Software
* Install Atom
  * [Download Atom](https://atom.io), a code-editor
  * Install and run it.
* Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)


## Ruby
If you haven’t completed it already, Codecademy has a Ruby course that you should walk through to familiarize yourself with the concepts.

<http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby>

### Supplemental
HTML/CSS will be covered in the course, but to the same depth as Ruby and Rails, so it would benefit you extremely to be familiar with building websites.

<http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web>

## The Command Line
The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

Especially if you’ve never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.

1. Read <http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/>
2. <http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics>
3. <http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/>
4. Read and practice with [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-li…)

In case you're not sure how to get to the command line on your Mac, here's a hint: There's an application called "Terminal" buried in the "Utilities" folder inside the "Applications" folder ...

Or do a Spotlight search for it. That's likely easier.

## git
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It is a command line tool that we will be using for every project we do in class. Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but just to start to get comfortable.

### Supplemental
If you want to spend some more time with git, [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a great resource.

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based hosting and communication service for software development projects that uses the Git revision control system.

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at <https://github.com/>
2. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name.
3. Email me ([chris.vannoy@theironyard.com](mailto:chris.vannoy@theironyard.com)) the username you choose so that I can get you added to the group we'll be using for class.
4. Complete <https://try.github.io/>

### Supplemental
Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn how to use GitHub prior to class.

## Extra handy resources

Of note: This entire section is completely optional. I'm not expecting you to know or do all of this. After all, that's what class is for.

### Books

First, a quick note on programming books:

They can get out of date _very_ quickly. For instance, one of the books listed below covers Ruby 2.1, while we'll be using Ruby 2.2 in class. There are not hugely impactful differences between the two, but it's something to keep in mind.

Both books are intended more to help guide _thinking_ about Ruby and programming in general than any specific syntax.

* **[Eloquent Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431654647&sr=8-1&keywords=eloquent+ruby):** Great, quick read that covers Ruby from beginning to end with a focus more on thinking like a Rubyist.
* **[The Well-Grounded Rubyist](http://www.amazon.com/Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431660063&sr=8-1&keywords=well-grounded+rubyist):** A bit deeper than "Eloquent," but a similar back-to-front look at Ruby.

### Tangential subjects

These following subjects we'll cover either deeply in class or will touch on only a little (Markdown in particular will be covered very lightly if at all). That said, it never hurts to get familiar - even if it might not make sense just yet.

* **[GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)**
* **[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)**
* **[jQuery](https://jquery.com)**
* **[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com)**
* **[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com)**
* **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org)**
* **[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org)**
* **[SQL](http://www.sqlteaching.com)**

### Videos

If you want to get a better idea of the Ruby (and Rails specifically) community, RailsConf does a great job posting their talk videos.

Here's a huge list of the [2015 conference talks](http://confreaks.tv/events/railsconf2015).

### Local Indy Community

I've been part of the Ruby community here in Indianapolis since the very beginning and it's been fun to watch it blossom over the years.

For your purposes, you can start getting involved now if you'd like.

There's a well-attended (and friendly!) [monthly meetup](http://www.meetup.com/indyrb/), and associated IRC and [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/invitations/94a1bf817fd42ec852f693da30f685ddccb57a7c) groups. The group's [website](http://indyrb.org) has more information.

The Rubyist community here in Indy is truly great and you're going to enjoy being a part of it.

## Closing

As I mentioned at the top (and goodness, that seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?), I'm really looking forward to working with you in this class.

I'd like to reiterate one key point:

For these 12 short weeks, we're all in this together. Our goal as a class should be to make each other better and give freely of our knowledge to help others succeed. That's, of course, my primary goal, but this class will really hum if we're all rowing together.

And I have high hopes that we will be.

See you on June 29th!

I can't wait.
